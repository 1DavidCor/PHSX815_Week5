# PHSX815_Week5

PHSX815_HW5.py: This script demonstrates the concept of rejection sampling using a uniform distribution [0,1] and a target distribution bounded by the x-axis and the function f(x) = sin^2(20x) defined on the interval [0,1]. This program produces a two randomly distributed uniform samples of size N (one for x-coordinates, one for y-coordinates), then sorts them according to the rejection/acceptance criterion: if the point (x_i,y_i) < f(x_i), the point is accepted--rejected otherwise. Then, the script constructs a plot of the function f(x) overlayed with the accepted/rejected points (each plotted in a different color). Finally, the program prints out the number of accepts, rejects, and the ratio of accepts to sample size. The plot is titled "Rejection_sampling.png"
